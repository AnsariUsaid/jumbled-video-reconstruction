# Algorithm Description: Jumbled Video Frame Reconstruction

## Executive Summary

This project implements a computer vision-based solution to reconstruct a jumbled video by reordering its frames. The algorithm uses **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)** feature detection combined with **graph-based optimization** to determine the correct frame sequence.

---

## Problem Statement

**Given:** A video file with randomly shuffled frames.

**Goal:** Reconstruct the original video by determining the correct sequential order of frames.

**Challenges:**
- No temporal metadata available
- Frames are randomly ordered
- Need to identify which frames are temporally adjacent
- Must handle 300+ frames efficiently

## Algorithm Overview

### Phase 1: Feature Extraction

**ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) Feature Detection**

We chose ORB over other feature detectors (SIFT, SURF) for several reasons:

1. **Speed**: ORB is 100x faster than SIFT
2. **Binary descriptors**: Use Hamming distance (faster than Euclidean)
3. **Rotation invariance**: Handles camera movement
4. **Free and open-source**: No patent restrictions

**Process:**
```
For each frame:
1. Convert to grayscale (reduces computational complexity)
2. Detect keypoints using FAST corner detector
3. Compute ORB descriptors (256-bit binary strings)
4. Extract 500 keypoints per frame
```

**Output:** Each frame represented by 500 descriptors (500 x 32 bytes)

### Phase 2: Similarity Matrix Construction

**Brute-Force Matching with Hamming Distance**

For every pair of frames (i, j):
1. Use BFMatcher (Brute-Force Matcher) with Hamming distance
2. Match descriptors between frames
3. Count total matches
4. Store in similarity matrix M[i,j]

**Key Insight:** Consecutive video frames share many visual features, resulting in high match counts. Non-consecutive frames have fewer matches.

**Complexity:** O(n² × m²) where n = number of frames, m = keypoints per frame
- For 300 frames: 44,850 comparisons
- Execution time: ~3-4 minutes

**Output:** 300×300 similarity matrix (352KB)

### Phase 3: Frame Ordering - Graph-Based Approach

**Problem Formulation:**
- **Nodes**: Individual frames
- **Edges**: Similarity scores between frames
- **Goal**: Find Hamiltonian path (visit each node exactly once) that maximizes total edge weight

**Algorithm: Hybrid Greedy + 2-opt Optimization**

#### Step 1: Find Optimal Starting Point
```
Find the frame pair (i, j) with maximum similarity
Rationale: Highest similarity likely indicates consecutive frames
Result: Frames 180 and 288 (similarity: 478/500)
```

#### Step 2: Greedy Nearest Neighbor Construction
```
Starting from best pair, build path:
1. Mark current frame as visited
2. Find unvisited frame with highest similarity to current
3. Add to path and mark as visited
4. Repeat until all frames visited

Try both directions (starting from frame i and frame j)
Select path with higher total score
```

#### Step 3: 2-opt Local Optimization
```
Improve path quality using 2-opt swaps:
For each segment [i, j] in path:
    Reverse segment [i, j]
    If total path score improves:
        Keep the reversal
    Else:
        Revert to original
Repeat until no improvement found
```

**Why This Approach?**

| Approach | Time Complexity | Quality | Trade-offs |
|----------|----------------|---------|------------|
| Greedy NN | O(n²) | Good | Fast but local optimum |
| Exact TSP | O(n! or 2ⁿ) | Optimal | Too slow for n>20 |
| 2-opt | O(n²) per iteration | Near-optimal | Best balance |
| Our Hybrid | O(n²) | Near-optimal | Fast + high quality |

**Results:**
- Initial greedy path score: 132,717
- After 2-opt optimization: 133,104
- Improvement: 387 points (0.29%)
- Average consecutive similarity: 445/500 (89%)
- Execution time: ~2 seconds

### Phase 4: Video Reconstruction

**Simple Sequential Write:**
```
1. Load optimal frame order
2. Read frames in determined sequence
3. Write to video file using cv2.VideoWriter
4. Output: MP4 file with correctly ordered frames
```

**Parameters:**
- Codec: MP4V
- Frame rate: 30 FPS
- Resolution: 1920×1080 (preserved from original)

## Algorithm Trade-offs and Alternatives

### Why Not Deep Learning?

**Considered:** CNN-based temporal ordering, LSTM for sequence prediction

**Rejected because:**
- Requires training data (we have only one video)
- Overkill for feature-based problem
- Longer development time
- Higher computational requirements

### Why Not Brute Force Search?

**Factorial complexity:** 300! possible orderings
- Even checking 1 billion orderings per second would take longer than universe's age
- Clearly infeasible

### Why Not Clustering First?

**Scene-based clustering + internal ordering:**

**Pros:**
- Could identify distinct scenes
- Parallelizable

**Cons:**
- Need to know number of scenes (unknown)
- Two-stage process increases complexity
- May break smooth transitions
- Our video appears to be continuous

## Future Improvements

### 1. Parallel Processing
Current similarity computation is serial. Could use multiprocessing:
```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
# Compute similarity matrix in parallel chunks
# Expected speedup: 4-8x on modern CPUs
```

### 2. Adaptive Feature Count
Instead of fixed 500 keypoints:
- Use more for complex scenes
- Fewer for simple/static scenes
- Could improve both speed and accuracy

### 3. Multi-Scale Matching
- Match at multiple image scales
- Better handle zooming/perspective changes

### 4. Temporal Consistency Check
- Verify that ordered sequence makes physical sense
- Check for impossible transitions (e.g., sudden scene jumps)

### 5. Hybrid Feature Descriptors
- Combine ORB with color histograms
- Add motion vectors if available
- Could improve accuracy by 5-10%
