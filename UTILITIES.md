## üìù logger.py - Execution Time Tracker

### Purpose
Tracks and logs execution time for each phase of the pipeline with timestamps.

### Functions

#### `start_phase(phase_name)`
Records the start time when a phase begins.
```python
logger.start_phase("Phase 2: Frame Extraction")
# Output: [2025-10-25 16:20:00] Starting: Phase 2: Frame Extraction
```

#### `end_phase(phase_name, details="")`
Calculates and logs elapsed time when a phase completes.
```python
logger.end_phase("Phase 2: Frame Extraction", "300 frames extracted")
# Output: [2025-10-25 16:20:05] Completed: Phase 2 | Time: 5.23s | 300 frames extracted
```

#### `log(message)`
Adds a timestamped message to the log.
```python
logger.log("Starting similarity computation")
# Output: [2025-10-25 16:20:10] Starting similarity computation
```

#### `save()`
Writes all log entries to `execution_log.txt`.

### Example Output (execution_log.txt)
```

## üîÑ run_pipeline.py - Automated Full Pipeline

### Purpose
Runs the entire video reconstruction pipeline automatically with integrated timing.

### What It Does
1. **Verifies Setup** - Checks directories exist
2. **Extracts Frames** - Calls `extract_frames.py`
3. **Extracts Features** - Calls `extract_features.py`
4. **Builds Matrix** - Calls `build_similarity_matrix.py`
5. **Orders Frames** - Calls `order_frames.py`
6. **Reconstructs Video** - Calls `reconstruct_video.py`
7. **Logs Everything** - Saves timing to `execution_log.txt`

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ **One Command**: Run entire project with one script
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Timing**: No need to manually time each phase
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Stops and logs if any phase fails
- ‚úÖ **Progress Tracking**: See what's happening in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Reproducible**: Same results every time

### Usage
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python src/run_pipeline.py
```

### Console Output Example
```

## üìä Comparison of Approaches

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `run_pipeline.py` | Run complete pipeline | Production, first-time setup |
| Individual scripts | Run specific phases | Debugging, testing changes |
| `logger.py` | Track timing | Performance analysis |
| `Algorithm_Description.md` | Understand approach | Learning, presentations |

---

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

### For First-Time Users:
1. Read main `README.md`
2. Run `python src/run_pipeline.py`
3. Check `execution_log.txt` for timing
4. View `output/reconstructed_video.mp4`

### For Developers:
1. Read `Algorithm_Description.md` first
2. Run individual scripts to test changes
3. Use `logger.py` in your own scripts
4. Document improvements

### For Researchers:
1. Start with `Algorithm_Description.md`
2. Examine trade-offs section
3. Review performance metrics
4. Consider suggested improvements

---

## üí° Tips

### Viewing Logs
```bash
# View execution log
cat execution_log.txt

# Watch log in real-time (while running)
tail -f execution_log.txt
```

### Debugging
If a phase fails:
1. Check `execution_log.txt` for error timestamp
2. Run that specific phase script manually
3. Fix the issue
4. Re-run `run_pipeline.py` (it will skip completed phases)

### Performance Tracking
Compare execution times across runs:
```bash
# Save log with timestamp
cp execution_log.txt logs/run_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
```
